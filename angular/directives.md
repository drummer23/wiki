#Directives

They apply special behavior to attributes or elements in the HTML.

Some of them are:

-	**ng-app**
	automatically initializes our application

-	**ng-model**
	store/updates the value of input field into/from a variable (bindâ€™s the
	model)

-	**expression**
	JavaScript-like code snippet that allows Angular to read and write
	variables {{ expression | filter }}

-	**ng-controller**
	tells Angular that Controller X is responsible for the element with the
	directive and all of the element's children

-	**ng-click**
	This will evaluate the corresponding expression whenever the
	button is clicked.
