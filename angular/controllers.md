#Controllers

The purpose of controllers is to **expose variables and functionality to expressions and
directives**.

The ng-controller directive tells Angular that a Controller is responsible for the element
with the directive and all of the element's children. The syntax Controller as XY tells
Angular to instantiate the controller and save it in the variable XY in the current scope.
