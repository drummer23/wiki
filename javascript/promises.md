#Promises

https://github.com/kriskowal/q

If a function cannot return a value or throw an exception without blocking, it can return a promise instead. A promise is an object that represent the return value or the thrown exception that the function may eventually provide.

Promises have a `then method, which you can use to get the eventual return value (fulfillment) or thrown expextion (recection).
